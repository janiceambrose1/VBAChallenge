# VBAChallenge

In this assignement we used VBA to analyze the stock data that was given. 
As you can see in my code I looped through each year of stock and then grabbed the amount of volume throughout the entire year 
I made sure to use conditional formatting to show the positive and negative change: 
  Positive = green & Negative = Red
